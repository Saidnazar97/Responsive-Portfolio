                Relationships and You Can Too…</h5>
              <article class="card-text">
                I think my story with social skills is a pretty common one.

                I was deathly shy, especially around women. To the point that I hadn’t had a date in several years.

                I quite often found it hard to come up with things to say or to start a conversation in school, at a
                party or at some kind of meeting.

                So the # 1 thing for me was to get better socially.

                Because I wanted to feel more confident and less shy. Be able to connect better and deeper with people.

                And I wanted to be socially free and have the skills and habits to live and create my life as I wanted.

                Now, not having helpful social skills can be terribly restricting.

                It can sometimes feel like life never seems to really start for you or truly grow compared to the people
                you see around you as they express themselves genuinely and confidently, go on dates and seem to be at
                ease with meeting new people.

              <article class="card">But this is not something that is set in stone. Over the past years
                things
                have
                changed a lot for me. A
                part of me is still introverted,
                I still love to read and to be by myself for some time each week. But I am also in an awesome
                relationship with a wonderful woman now and have been with her for the last 8 years. And I have become
                so much more confident and relaxed socially. Nowadays it feels fun and exciting instead of nerve-racking
                to connect with people.</article>
